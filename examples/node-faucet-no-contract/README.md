Woop Faucet (No Contract)

## Overview
This is an example of a faucet used to distribute Woop WOC tokens. If you would like to see an example of this faucet with a smart contract, please see the `node-faucet` example instead.

## Pre-requisites
NodeJS and JavaScript knowledge

## Install
```
npm i
```
## Configure
Check out the config.js file first

These are the environmental variables that need to be set to run the faucet. They can be set from the command line or in a .env file in the same directory as this README

* `ENV`: the network you're deploying to, `local`, `testnet`, or `mainnet`. This readme assumes `ENV` is set to `testnet`.
* `TESTNET_CHAIN_ID`: the chain id of the network you're connecting to (3 for OSTN, 4 for PTN) (Not applicable to `local` or `mainnet` networks).
* `TESTNET_0_URL`: the URL endpoint of the network you are connecting to. Replace `TESTNET` with `LOCAL` or `MAINNET` if you are targeting those networks.
* `TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY`: the private key of the faucet account. This account pays for both the transactions and the funded account. Replace `TESTNET` with `LOCAL` or `MAINNET` if you are targeting those networks.
* `GAS_LIMIT`: amount of gas allotted to transactions. defaults to `2000000` gas.
* `GAS_PRICE`: amount of WOC to pay for each unit of gas. defaults to `1000000000` atto, (0.000000001 WOC).
* `TIME_LIMIT`: amount of time in ms before an address is allowed to fund again, defaults to `3600000` ms (1 hour).
* `TX_RATE`: amount in WOC to pay out from the faucet, defaults to `11000` WOC.
* `RECAPTCHA_SECRET`: the secret recaptcha key provided by google's reCAPTCHA. Defaults to a testing key.
* `RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC`: the public recaptcha key provided by google's reCAPTCHA. Defaults to a testing key.
* `PROXY`: whether the faucet is behind a reverse proxy such as nginx. Make sure to also adjust proxy settings. Default value is `false`.
* `USAGE_LIMIT`: amount of times the faucet can be used per IP. Default value is `10`

**The corresponding recaptcha public token must replace the `data-sitekey` attribute value of the recaptcha div in `/src/index.html` line 22**
